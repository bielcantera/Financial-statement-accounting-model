# Financial Statement Accounting Model

## Overview
This project is an Excel-based accounting model developed as a final academic project.  
It represents the full accounting cycle for a small business (**Reial Club de Pàdel Roldans**), from transaction recording to final financial statements.

The objective of the project is to demonstrate a solid understanding of accounting fundamentals, including journal entries, ledger posting, cost calculation, and balance sheet preparation.

## Business Context
The model simulates the accounting activity of a padel club, including:
- Daily transactions
- Inventory-related costs
- Monthly account balances
- Financial position reporting

The workbook is designed to show how individual transactions propagate through the accounting system and impact the final statements.
